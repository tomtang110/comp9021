'''
Iteratively computes the pageranks of the 11 nodes of the graph
of the wikipedia entry that illustrates the pagerank algorithm, with a damping factor of 0.85.

The number of iterations is input by the user, prompted to do so.

Outputs the labels and pageranks of pages from largest to smallest value.
