'''
Uses Heath Nutrition and Population statistics, avalaible at
http://datacatalog.worldbank.org, stored in the file HNP_Data.csv,
assumed to be stored in the working directory.

Prompts the user for an Indicator Name. If it exists and is associated with
a numerical value for some countries or categories, for some the years 1960-2015,
then finds out the maximum value, and outputs:
- that value;
- the years when that value was reached, from oldest to more recents years;
- for each such year, the countries or categories for which that value was reached,
  listed in lexicographic order.
