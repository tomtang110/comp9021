# Defines two classes, Point() and Triangle().
# An object for the second class is created by passing named arguments,
# point_1, point_2 and point_3, to its constructor.
# Such an object can be modified by changing one point, two or three points
# thanks to the method change_point_or_points().
# At any stage, the object maintains correct values
# for perimeter and area.
