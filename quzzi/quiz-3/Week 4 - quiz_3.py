# Randomly generates a grid with 0s and 1s, whose dimension is controlled by user input,
# as well as the density of 1s in the grid, and finds out, for a given direction being
# one of N, E, S or W (for North, East, South or West) and for a given size greater than 1,
# the number of triangles pointing in that direction, and of that size.
#
# Triangles pointing North:
# - of size 2:
#   1
# 1 1 1
# - of size 3:
#     1
#   1 1 1
# 1 1 1 1 1
#
# Triangles pointing East:
# - of size 2:
# 1
# 1 1
# 1
# - of size 3:
# 1
# 1 1
# 1 1 1 
# 1 1

# Triangles pointing South:
# - of size 2:
# 1 1 1

#
# The output lists, for every direction and for every size, the number of triangles
# pointing in that direction and of that size, provided there is at least one such triangle.
# For a given direction, the possble sizes are listed from largest to smallest.
#
# We do not count triangles that are truncations of larger triangles, that is, obtained
# from the latter by ignoring at least one layer, starting from the base.
